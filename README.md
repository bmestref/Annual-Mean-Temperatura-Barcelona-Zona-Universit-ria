This study investigates the temporal trend of mean annual air temperature in the Barcelona Zona Universitària meteorological station over a 16-year period (2009--2025). Data were aggregated to yearly means and analyzed using a linear regression model to quantify the temperature change as a function of the year. The regression analysis revealed a positive annual temperature trend, estimated at $0.13 \, {}^{\circ}\text{C}$ per year. This finding provides a preliminary assessment of local temperature dynamics, highlighting the need for long-term data collection to confirm statistical significance for climate trend reporting. Here you will be able to find the article as well as the codes which were employed to arrive at the conclusions stated in the paper.
